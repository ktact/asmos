# ASMOS
This repository contains the source code for an operating system written entirely in assembly language.

## Getting Started
To build this project, you will need a Unix-like environment with the following tools:

* `nasm`
* `qemu-system-i386`

Once you have these tools installed, you can build the operating system by running the following command:
```bash
$ make run
```
